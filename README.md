Dirt Rally Issue Tracker
=============

We have decided to use Github as official place for Dirt Rally Issue Tracker.

Main goal of this tracker is to detect bugs and report them asap to Dirt Rally development team. Also, it's a good place for feature requests. If you have an idea in mind, here is the best place to share it with everyone!

To use this issue tracker, you will have to sign up at Github.com. It's very easy!

All feature requests will be reviewed by the development team and will be either accepted or rejected! Unfortunately, it is not possible to implement all the wished features. 

We love to say: **"less is more."**

To add a new issue, click [here](/dirtrally/issue-tracker/issues)

Rules
=====

1. This tracker should be strictly used only for posting a bug, which you found on the website.
2. Feature request (nice idea, which could improve the game)
3. New supporter feature (supporter feature list is too small? Suggest your feature!)

It is not allowed to discuss game related things, like, what setup is the best for this rally, etc, or to ask things about how game is working. There is another place to do that!
