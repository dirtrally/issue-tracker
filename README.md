Dirt Rally Issue Tracker
=============

We have decided to use Github as official place for Dirt Rally Issue Tracker.

Main goal of this tracker is to detect bugs and report them asap to Dirt Rally development team. Also, it's a good place for feature requests. If you have an idea in mind, here is the best place to share it with everyone!

To use this issue tracker, you will have to sign up at Github.com. It's very easy!

All feature requests will be reviewed by the development team and will be either accepted or rejected! Unfortunately, it is not possible to implement all the wished features. 

We love to say: **"less is more."**
