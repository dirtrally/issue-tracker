Dirt Rally Issue Tracker
=============

We have decided to use Github as official place for Dirt Rally Issue Tracker.

Main goal of this tracker is to detect bugs and report them asap to Dirt Rally development team. Also, it's a good place for feature requests. If you have an idea in mind, here is the best place to share it with everyone!
